# How I came up with TrailTracer
TrailTracer came to me, as a mother, after my son told me at the end of second grade that he wanted to ride his bike to school without me. I was hesitant and curious how he do navigating his way. I decided that I owed him the chance to build his independence and confidence and so, I created TrailTracer.

## Planning
For this project, I took a similar approach to my first midterm, Calm Lights, and broke the code down into sub-codes before adding them together. I divided my first part of the two week timeline into coding and insuring the device could work then I spent the second week troubleshooting componets, testing out the device, which brought me v2 TrailTracer.

## Future Goals
My future goals for this project include adding a button to the device for communication purposes, adding feed to the dashboard to change the light color, and adding in a feature to see speed, traffic for the area and weather.
